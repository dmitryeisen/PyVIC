PyVIC (Python Virtual Input Console) is an application for simulating HID devices (keyboard and mouse) and displaying real-time screen data via camera capturing. This tool provides a simple way to test input devices and visual feedback.

🛠️ Features

	•	KVM Simulation:
	•	Simulates keyboard and mouse inputs (HID).
	•	Sends movements, clicks, and keystrokes directly to the target system.
	•	Screen Capturing:
	•	Displays live frames from a connected camera.
	•	Supports real-time display without noticeable delay.
	•	User-Friendly:
	•	Compatible with Linux and macOS.
	•	Supports plug-and-play for USB devices.

📦 Installation

Requirements

Python 3.9 or higher.

Dependencies:

	•	pygame

	•	pyserial

Install dependencies with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Start the application:

    python main.py


Test functionality:
    •	Connect HID devices and a USB camera.
    •	Test mouse and keyboard inputs in the Pygame window.

    •	Press Ctrl + C or close the window.

⚙️ Configuration

HID Devices

The app automatically searches for USB serial devices (usbserial, ttyUSB).
